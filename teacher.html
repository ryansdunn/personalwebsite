                        I did not have the traditional education experience. I attended a Montessori School, a New York public school, a school in Almuñecar Spain, and I homeschooled, all before attending Carleton College. 
                        What I've learned is that education systems often view learning as something that a student goes to school to experience. However, learning is not something that can be forced on a student at any given place, it comes from a place of curiosity and love.
                        I strive to approach teaching as a partnership where both the student and the teacher can grow. Students deserve the opportunity to follow their passions and curiosity. I want to be a part of exchanging knowledge, interests, and respect 
                        so that students can better discover their own passions and the skills they need to live their own life.
